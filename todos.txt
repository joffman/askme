General:
- Add e2e testing.
- Use "lectures" instead of "collections".
  A lecture can include a long text with multiple chapters and
  images and videos. The cards/quizzes should just be a part of
  the lectures.
- Add user management.

Frontend:
- Complete the unit tests.
- Add submenu that is specific to the view.
  E.g. for the collection-list it would include the search field.
- Add help and info tooltips/buttons.
- Use caching to reduce the number of API-calls.

Backend:
- Add https and put the site online.
- Add tests.
- Get rid of the nodejs warnings.
- Understand express-flash and -session and passport modules.
- What happens in login.js when the user is already logged in?
- Restrict access to an upload to the user who did the upload.
  Maybe add another folder: /uploads/userId/cardId
- Restrict access to collections and cards to the person who
  created them (except for public / published collections/cards.
